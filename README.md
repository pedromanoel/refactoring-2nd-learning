# refactoring-2nd-learning

This repository contains the code sample for the first chapter of
[Refactoring, 2nd ed, by Martin Fowler][ref_book].

## Purpose

I started this repository as a way to study the book in practice.

## How to explore

The way you can explore this repository is to step by each commit
from one of the `refactoring-*` branches. You can follow each commit
together with each step described in the book.
